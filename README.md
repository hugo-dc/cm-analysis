# Code Merkleization Analysis

This repository contains the data generated by a modified version of geth in
order to get information about proof size needed for block execution when
contract's code is merkleized. It also contains the Python notebook's used to
analyse such data.

A render of the Python Notebook can be found
[here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hugo-dc/cm-analysis/blob/master/notebook/code_merkleization_analysis.ipynb).

## How to use the python notebook

The generated file from geth is a csv file, it has been compressed in order to
have a size allowed by GitHub.

Extracting the file:

    $ cd data/
    $ tar xvf result.csv.tar.gz

### Run Jupyter Notebooks

1. Enter the notebook directory

    $ cd notebook/

2. Install the requirements

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run Jupyter Notebooks

    $ jupyter-notebook
